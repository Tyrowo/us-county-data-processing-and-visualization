CSV with Pandas

'data frame' kind of like a spreadsheet in that it has rows and columns


import pandas as pd

#df for data frame 
df = pd.read_csv('file-path.csv')

print(df.head()) # will print out the top 5 lines of the data frame, see what's going on. 
	# .tail(10) also works, like bash, and changing value will change number of lines shown default 5

shipping_1day = df[(df['Shipping Type'] == '1 day')] 
	# this will only get rows where the column 'shipping type' has the value '1 day'

print(len(shipping_1day)) # prints how many entries have that value in the column

shipping_1day.to_csv('shipping-1.csv')
