# scatter plot is just points.
# to get a surface plot you have to combine the plots via a mesh - which combines the combinations which will plot surfaces

X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) 
Z = # just make sure this is a vector too 

ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z)
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap ='Spectral') # this creates a heat range from red to blue

ax.view_init(azim = 0, elev = 90) # change what direction you're initially looking at the map from. I think he said default is top-down
